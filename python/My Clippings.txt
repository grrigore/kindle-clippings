Think your idea's that valuable? Then go try to sell it and see what you get for it. Not much is probably the answer. Until you actually start making something, your brilliant idea is just that, an idea. And everyone's got one of those. Stanley Kubrick gave this advice to aspiring filmmakers: "Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all."* Kubrick knew that when you're new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin. So get a camera, hit Record, and start shooting.

A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby. So don't use the idea of a startup as a crutch. Instead, start an actual business. Actual businesses have to deal with actual things like bills and payroll. Actual businesses worry about profit from day one. Actual businesses don't mask deep problems by saying, "It's OK, we're a startup." Act like an actual business and you'll have a much better shot at succeeding.

People are creatures of habit. That's why they react to change in such a negative way. They're used to using something in a certain way and any change upsets the natural order of things. So they push back. They complain. They demand that you revert to the way things were. But that doesn't mean you should act.

Here's what's wrong with some of them: Need. Very few things actually need to get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with that?" Can't. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they? Easy. Easy is a word that's used to describe other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?" But notice how rarely people describe their own tasks as easy. For you, it's "Let me look into it"--but for others, it's "Get it done."

THINK BIG. Set your sights high and strive for something grand. If you’re going to change the world, you can’t do it with milquetoast and boring products or services. Shoot for doing things at least ten times better than the status quo. When Jeff Bezos started Amazon. com, he didn’t build a bookstore with a paltry 25,000 more titles than the 250,000-title brick-and-mortar bookstores. He went to 3,000,000 titles in an online bookstore.

History loves the notion of the sole innovator: Thomas Edison (light bulb), Steve Jobs (Macintosh), Henry Ford (Model T), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop), Richard Branson (Virgin Airlines).

POLARIZE PEOPLE. When you create a product or service that some people love, don’t be surprised when others hate you. Your goal is to catalyze passion—pro or anti. Don’t be offended if people take issue with what you’ve done; the only result that should offend (and scare) you is lack of interest.Car design is a good example of the love-versus-hate reaction; consider the bifurcation of people’s reactions to cars such as the Mini Cooper, Infiniti Fx45, and Toyota Scion xB. People are either devoted fans or relentless critics, and that’s good.

POSITIVE. Entrepreneurship isn’t war, so you don’t describe your enterprise in warlike terms. Your organization’s purpose is not to put another organization out of business.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC. Positioning is about what you do for your customers—not about what you want to become. Announcing that your organization is “the leading company” is egocentric, not customer-centric. It’s also impractical: How can you prove you’re the leader? How can you prevent another organization from declaring that it is the leader—just as you have?

SPECIFIC. Good positioning targets the intended customer. If you are the target customer, you immediately understand that. If you’re not, you understand that, too. For example, “increase the security of Web sites” is a mediocre and vague value proposition, compared to “reduce the risk of fraud for commercial banks in their online transactions.”

Spend the time and effort to come up with a good name—it makes positioning easier. Here are some tips for the process: HAVE A FIRST INITIAL THAT’S EARLY IN THE ALPHABET. Someday your organization’s, product’s, or service’s name will appear in an alphabetical list. Better to be early in the list than later. Imagine, for example, a trade show with a thousand exhibitors. Do you want to be in the first third or last third of the show’s directory?Also, avoid words that begin with X or Z because they are difficult to spell out after hearing them. For example, if you heard “Xylinx,” would you think that it’s spelled “Xylinx” or “Zylinx”? AVOID NUMBERS. They are bad ideas for names because people won’t remember whether to use numerals (123) or to spell out the number (One Two Three). PICK A NAME WITH “VERB POTENTIAL.” In a perfect world, your name enters the mainstream vernacular and becomes a verb. For example, people “xerox” documents—as opposed to photocopy them.More recently, people “google” words instead of “searching for them on the Internet.” Names that work as verbs are short (no more than two or three syllables) and not tongue twisters.

AWOA (a word on acronyms): Avoid multiple-word names unless the first word has solid verb potential (for example, “Google Technology Corporation” would still be fine) or the acronym spells out something clever. For example, the name Hawaiian Islands Ministry, a parachurch organization that trains pastors and ministers, becomes “HIM”—a clever homonym with “hymn” and a play on “Him,” that is, God.

SOUND DIFFERENT (AS OPPOSED TO “THINK DIFFERENT”). The name should sound like nothing else. For (a bad) example: Claris, Clarins, Claritin, and Claria. It’s hard to remember which name refers to software, cosmetics, antihistamines, or online marketing. Even if you did remember, it’s likely that you would associate all four words with one category, and that can’t be good in three of four instances. SOUND LOGICAL. In addition to sounding different, your names should also sound logical. That is, they should “match” what you do. A good example of this is the names of the Pokémon characters. They are among the most clever examples of naming that you’ll come across. Take Geodude and Lickitung, for example.Ask your kids to show you the cards of the characters Beautifly, Delcatty, Flygon, and Huntail, and you’ll see what I mean about logical names and good positioning. AVOID THE TRENDY. With hindsight, we made two mistakes naming Garage Technology Ventures when we started it in 1997. First, we initially called the company “garage.com.” Unfortunately, dotcom acquired negative connotations when the Internet tide went out because it came to stand for companies run by people without business acumen in markets without business models.The second mistake was lowercasing the “g” in garage.com. It was a silly act of pseudohumility, but those were silly times. The problem with the lowercase “g” was that it was hard to pick it out in blocks of text. The visual cue that the word was a proper noun wasn’t there—you’d think that someone named guy (sic) would know this. Also, no one could really figure out what to do when a sentence started with “garage.com”—should it be capitalized or not?

Before you cut yourself, heed this advice about the art of using PowerPoint as a means to an end. USE A DARK BACKGROUND. A dark background communicates seriousness and substance. A white or light background looks cheap and amateurish. Also, staring at a harsh white presentation for forty-five minutes gets tiring for the eyes. Think about this: Have you ever seen movie credits that use black text on a white background? ADD YOUR LOGO TO THE MASTER PAGE. Every presentation is a chance to build brand awareness for your organization, so put your logo on the master slide page. By doing this, your logo will appear on every slide. USE COMMON, SANS SERIF FONTS. A presentation is not the place to show that you’ve accumulated the world’s largest collection of fonts. Use common fonts because someday your presentation may need to be given on a computer that has a different collection of fonts than your computer has. Also, use sans serif fonts because they are much easier to read than the delicate serif font you love. You can never go wrong with Arial. ANIMATE YOUR BODY, NOT YOUR SLIDES. PowerPoint has more than sixty ways to animate text and graphics. This is about fifty-nine too many. Many entrepreneurs use animations and transitions between slides to jazz up their presentations. Do you really think that a “faded fly-in from the bottom left” is going to make a presentation better? Do yourself a favor: Don’t use fancy animations. Use your body, not PowerPoint, to communicate expressiveness, emotion, and enthusiasm. Generally speaking, if you think something is cool, cut it. “BUILD” BULLETS. Most entrepreneurs don’t use bullets. They display and read big blocks of long text. That’s a mistake. Use bullets instead: short bursts of text that capture the main point. Even when entrepreneurs use bullets, they put them all up at once. That’s also a mistake. Build your bullets: click, bullet 1, explain; click, bullet 2, explain; click, bullet 3, explain. This is the only time you should use animation, and I recommend using the simple “appear” animation at that. USE ONLY ONE LEVEL OF BULLETS. The use of bullets with bullets means that you’re trying to communicate too much information on a slide or that your thinking is fuzzy. Each slide should communicate one point, with bullets to support that point. If you observe the 30 part of the 10/20/30 rule, it will be hard to have bullets with bullets, anyway. ADD DIAGRAMS AND GRAPHS. Better a bullet than a block of text, but better a diagram or graph than a bullet. Use diagrams to explain how your business works. Use graphs to explain trends and numerical results. And build your diagrams and pictures by bringing in these elements with clicks, just like bullets. MAKE PRINTABLE SLIDES. There is a cautionary aspect to adding diagrams and graphics. Sometimes these objects build upon, and cover, previous ones. This is okay during a presentation but not when printed, so ensure that your slides work for this use, too.

SET AND COMMUNICATE GOALS. The simple act of setting goals and communicating them increases the likelihood that your organization will achieve them. It gets everyone on the same page and provides a day-to-day guide for what employees need to do. This applies to every task: finalizing specifications, building a prototype, signing up early customers, shipping, collecting, recruiting, finishing marketing materials…the list is endless. MEASURE PROGRESS. Goals only work if you measure progress. As the old saying goes, “What gets measured gets done.” This also means you’d better pick the right goals, or the wrong things will get done. In a startup, you should measure and report results every thirty days. As your organization gets older and more deliberate, you can shift to a quarterly schedule. ESTABLISH A SINGLE POINT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. If it takes more than ten seconds to figure out who is responsible for achieving a goal, something is wrong. Good people accept accountability. Great people ask for it. For the good of your entire organization, establish it. A person who knows he is being measured and held accountable is highly motivated to succeed. REWARD THE ACHIEVERS. The people you reward in a startup are the ones who deliver. You can use options, money, public praise, days off, or free lunches—it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you recognize achievers—and only achievers, not the people who are along for the ride. FOLLOW THROUGH UNTIL AN ISSUE IS DONE OR IRRELEVANT. We all like to work on the newest, hottest stuff. It’s human nature. Who wouldn’t rather be involved with the next breakthrough product rather than fixing the current one? Don’t stop when something simply gets boring. Fixing bugs may be boring to you, but it’s not to the customer who recently bought your product. HEED MORPHEUS. Realism is the ally of execution, so pay attention to what your Morpheus says. Everyone in a given company is in denial about something. Some denial is good for an entrepreneur—for example, denying that the “experts” are right when they say you can’t succeed. The critical issue is whether the denial is ultimately going to hurt the organization. Insist on realism, and your organization will bootstrap better. ESTABLISH A CULTURE OF EXECUTION. Execution is not a onetime event. Nor is it a process where you check off goals as if your sixth-grade teacher were looking over your shoulder. Rather, execution is a culture that produces a set of organizationwide habits. The only way to establish this culture is for the CEO to set the right example: answering inquiries, solving problems, and promoting people who deliver results. This sends an unmistakable message: Execution counts in this organization.

I can provide five ways to avoid hiring the wrong people: DON’T CONFUSE CORRELATION AND CAUSATION. A candidate may have worked at an organization when it achieved success; this doesn’t necessarily mean he contributed to the success. He could have just been along for the ride. The rising tide floats all boats. To separate the eagles from the dodos, find out what specific projects the candidate managed and analyze his results. Also, try to find someone inside the company who worked with the person to see if the candidate caused or correlated. DON’T CONFUSE BIG-ORGANIZATION SKILLS WITH NEW-ORGANIZATION SKILLS. Success in a big organization doesn’t guarantee success in a startup. The skills needed in each context are different. A vice president of Microsoft (with its established brand, infinite resources, and 100 percent market share) may not be the right person for a “two guys in a garage” operation.

Make it crystal clear that working in a startup is different from what they might be used to in their previous organization: “Can you function without a secretary, fly coach, and stay in cheap motels?” You might scare off a few desirable candidates this way, but it’s worth risking this to avoid ending up with people who cannot function in a startup atmosphere. READ THE TEA LEAVES WHEN CHECKING REFERENCES. Because the laws in the United States prevent providing job references that may damage a candidate’s ability to get a job, whenever you don’t get a reference that’s superlative, you are in effect getting a negative one. If the reference sends you to the human resources department, then you know the candidate had problems. (See the end of this chapter for more on reference checking.) TRUST THE RICHEST VEIN. Your current employees are the richest resource for finding great people and for preventing a bozo explosion at your organization. If your employees aren’t motivated to bring in good staff, who is? If there’s a close call between two candidates, and one is known by an employee, you should usually take that one.

Many entrepreneurs believe that investors want to hear that the organization has no competition. Unfortunately, sophisticated investors reach one or both of the following conclusions if entrepreneurs make such claims: There’s no competition because there’s no market. If there were a market, there would be others trying to win it. The founders are so clueless that they can’t even use Google to figure out that ten other companies are doing the same thing.

Lie #1: “Our projection is conservative.” Not only is your projection conservative, but you’ll be doing $100 million by year 3. In fact, the company is going to be the fastest-growing company in the history of mankind. Your projection isn’t conservative. Frankly, you have no clue what your sales will be. I fantasize about the day an entrepreneur tells me, “Frankly, our projection is a number we’re picking out of the air. We’re trying to make them high enough to interest you, but low enough so that we don’t look like idiots. We really will have no clue until we ship the product and see how it’s accepted.” At least that entrepreneur is honest.   Lie #2: “Gartner (Forrester, Jupiter, or Yankee Group) says our market will be $50 billion in five years.”   In Chapter 3 (“The Art of Pitching”), I discussed what listeners think when entrepreneurs try to “prove” market size, and I advocated “peeling away the onion” or catalyzing fantasy instead. To repeat my advice: Don’t cite these numbers and expect to impress investors. No one comes in and says, “We’re in a crappy little market.” Everyone does what you do. Lie #3: “Boeing is signing our contract next week.” As I said, traction is good. It really makes you fundable. But until a contract is signed, it’s not signed. When the investor checks in a week, and the contract isn’t signed, you’ve got a real problem. In five years, I’ve never seen a contract signed on time. Talk about Boeing and your big deals after they’re done. In general, make sure that all surprises to investors are upside surprises. Lie #4: “Key employees will join us as soon as we get funded.” Let me get this straight: You’re two guys in a garage, you’re trying to raise a few hundred thousand dollars, your product is twelve months from completion, and you’re telling me that these well-known people are going to resign their $250,000 per year, plus bonus, plus stock option jobs to join your company? When we’ve checked with these key employees about whether they’re in fact all set to join the company, the response, more often than not, is, “I vaguely remember meeting the CEO at a cocktail party.” If you’re going to tell this lie, make sure that these potential employees are locked and loaded and ready to quit. Lie #5: “Several investors are already in due diligence.” That is, “If you don’t hurry, someone else will invest in us, and you won’t have the chance.” This works well in times of irrational exuberance, but it is generally a laughable tactic. The reality, and what the listener is thinking, is You’ve pitched a few other investors, and they haven’t gotten around to rejecting you yet. The odds are that the investors know one another better than you know them. They can easily call up their buddies and find out how interested another firm is in your deal. To pull this lie off, you’d better be either a great bluffer or smokin’ hot, or you won’t have a chance against the investor network. Lie #6: “Procter & Gamble is too old, big, dumb, and slow to be a threat.” Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Oracle, Ford…pick a successful company. Many entrepreneurs think that by making such a statement, they are (a) convincing the investor of their moxie, (b) proving that they can defeat an entrenched competitor, and (c) establishing a competitive advantage. In reality, they are showing how naïve they are about what it takes to build a successful business. There’s a reason why people such as Larry Ellison can keep the San Jose airport open late for their private jets while you and I are munching peanuts on Southwest Airlines. And it’s not because they are old, big, dumb, and slow. It’s scary enough to investors that you are competing with an established company. Don’t seal your coffin by showing how clueless you are by denigrating such competition. Instead, build the case for these kinds of alternatives: partnering with the competition flying under its radar addressing a niche that it can’t or won’t address Lie #7: “Patents make our business defensible.” Patents do not make a business defensible. They might provide a temporary competitive advantage—particularly in material science, medical devices, and biotech companies—but that’s about it. Garage, for example, has a patent on the process of investors and entrepreneurs using the Internet to catalyze investments. Do I sleep better at night because of this? Has it prevented investment banks, laid-off investment bankers, and consultants from using the Internet to connect buyers and sellers of private placements? Would we try to enforce the patent? The answers are, respectively, no, no, and no. By all means, file for patents if you can, but don’t depend on them for much more than impressing your parents unless you have the time (years) and money (millions) to go to court. If Apple and the U.S. Department of Justice can’t beat Microsoft in court, you can’t, either. When talking to investors, the optimal number of times to mention that your technology is patentable is one. Zero is bad because it implies you don’t have anything proprietary. More than one mention means that you’re inexperienced and think patents make your business defensible. Lie #8: “All we have to do is get 1 percent of the market.” This is what venture capitalists call the Chinese Soda Lie. That is, “If just 1 percent of the people in China drink our soda, we will be more successful than any company in the history of mankind.” There are four problems with this line of reasoning: It’s not that easy to get 1 percent of the people in China to drink your soda. Very few entrepreneurs are truly going after a market as large as all the people in China. The company that came in before you said something similar about another market. So will the company after you. A company that is shooting for only 1 percent market share isn’t interesting.* The right thing to do, as I discussed earlier, is to either come up with a believable total addressable market figure or catalyze fantasy so the investor can come up with a number himself. But saying that all you have to do is get 1 percent of a big market labels you a bozo. Lie #9: “We have first-mover advantage.” There are at least two problems with this lie. First, it may not actually be true. How can you possibly know that no one else is doing what you’re doing? As a rule of thumb, if you’re doing something good, five other organizations are doing the same thing. If you’re doing something great, ten are. Second, first-mover advantage isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. Being a “fast second” might be better—let someone else pioneer the concept, learn from their mistakes, and leapfrog them. Lie #10: “We have a world-class, proven team.” The acceptable definition of world-class and proven in this context is that the founders created enormous wealth for investors in a previous company, or they held positions in highly respected, publicly traded companies. Riding the tornado of a successful company in a minor role, working for McKinsey as a consultant, or putting in a couple of years at Morgan Stanley doesn’t count as a proven background.

Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. Time for leisure, time for family and friends. Or time for doing absolutely nothing. Yes, it’s perfectly okay to have nothing to do. Or, better yet, nothing worth doing. If you’ve only got three hours of work to do on a given day, then stop. Don’t fill your day with five more just to stay busy or feel productive. Not doing something that isn’t worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time.

It’s especially tempting to think that if you work in a small company, you could really benefit from someone with the experience from a big company to help you “grow up.” But trying to teach a small company how to act like a big one rarely does anyone any good. You’re usually better off finding someone who’s familiar with the challenges at your company’s size or thereabouts.

Unwinding the new normal requires far more effort than preventing that new normal from being set in the first place. If you don’t want gnarly roots in your culture, you have to mind the seeds. You don’t have to let something slide for long before it becomes the new normal. Culture is what culture does. Culture isn’t what you intend it to be. It’s not what you hope or aspire for it to be. It’s what you do. So do better.

You just can’t bring your A game to every situation. Knowing when to embrace Good Enough is what gives you the opportunity to be truly excellent when you need to be. We’re not suggesting you put shit work out there. You need to be able to be proud of it, even if it’s only “okay.” But attempting to be indiscriminately great at everything is a foolish waste of energy.

The act of separation should be your highest-quality endeavor. It’s easy to say “Everything has to be great,” but anyone can do that. The challenge lies in figuring out where you can be just kinda okay or even downright weak.

Saying no is the only way to claw back time. Don’t shuffle 12 things so that you can do them in a different order, don’t set timers to move on from this or that. Eliminate 7 of the 12 things, and you’ll have time left for the 5. It’s not time management, it’s obligation elimination. Everything else is snake oil.

You’ll often hear that people don’t like change, but that’s not quite right. People have no problem with change they asked for. What people don’t like is forced change—change they didn’t request on a timeline they didn’t choose. Your “new and improved” can easily become their “what the fuck?” when it is dumped on them as a surprise.

Here’s something that should be obvious: People don’t like to have their grievances downplayed or dismissed. When that happens, even the smallest irritation can turn into an obsessive crusade. Imagine you’re staying at a hotel, and the air-conditioning isn’t working right. You call the front desk to mention it, and they say, oh yeah, they know about that, and someone is going to come fix that next week (after you’ve left). In the meantime, could you just open a window (down to that noisy, busy street)? Not a word of apology, no tone of contrition. Now what was a mild annoyance—that it’s 74F degrees when you like to sleep at 69F—is suddenly the end of the world! You swell with righteous fury, swear you’ll write a letter to management, and savage the hotel in your online review. Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says “It’s no big deal” or the token that says “It’s the end of the world.” Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other. The hotel staff in the example above clearly took the “It’s no big deal” token and as a result forced you to take the “It’s the end of the world” token. But they could just as well have made the opposite choice. Imagine the staff answering something like this: “We’re so sorry. That’s clearly unacceptable! I can completely understand how it must be almost impossible to sleep when it’s so hot in your room. If I can’t fix this problem for you tonight, would you like me to refund your stay and help you find a different hotel room nearby? In any case, while we’re figuring out the solution, allow me to send up a bottle of ice water and some ice cream. We’re terribly sorry for this ordeal and we’ll do everything to make it right.” With an answer like that, you’re almost forced to pick the “It’s no big deal” token. Yeah, sure, some water and ice cream would be great! Everyone wants to be heard and respected. It usually doesn’t cost much to do, either. And it doesn’t really matter all that much whether you ultimately think you’re right and they’re wrong. Arguing with heated feelings will just increase the burn.
