Foreground Application has a visible component in front, Service is bound to an Activity in front in a remote process, or BroadcastReceiver is running. Visible Application has a visible component but is partly obscured. Service Service is executing in the background and is not tied to a visible component. Background A nonvisible Activity. This is the process level that contains most applications. Empty A process without active components. Empty processes are kept around to improve startup times, but they are the first to be terminated when the system reclaims resources.

Think your idea's that valuable? Then go try to sell it and see what you get for it. Not much is probably the answer. Until you actually start making something, your brilliant idea is just that, an idea. And everyone's got one of those. Stanley Kubrick gave this advice to aspiring filmmakers: "Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all."* Kubrick knew that when you're new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin. So get a camera, hit Record, and start shooting.

A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby. So don't use the idea of a startup as a crutch. Instead, start an actual business. Actual businesses have to deal with actual things like bills and payroll. Actual businesses worry about profit from day one. Actual businesses don't mask deep problems by saying, "It's OK, we're a startup." Act like an actual business and you'll have a much better shot at succeeding.

Here's what's wrong with some of them: Need. Very few things actually need to get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with that?" Can't. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they? Easy. Easy is a word that's used to describe other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?"

History loves the notion of the sole innovator: Thomas Edison (light bulb), Steve Jobs (Macintosh), Henry Ford (Model T), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop), Richard Branson (Virgin Airlines). History is wrong. Successful companies are started, and made successful, by at least two, and usually more, soulmates. After the fact, one person may come to be recognized as the innovator,” but it always takes a team of good people to make any venture work.

POLARIZE PEOPLE. When you create a product or service that some people love, don’t be surprised when others hate you. Your goal is to catalyze passion—pro or anti. Don’t be offended if people take issue with what you’ve done; the only result that should offend (and scare) you is lack of interest.Car design is a good example of the love-versus-hate reaction; consider the bifurcation of people’s reactions to cars such as the Mini Cooper, Infiniti Fx45, and Toyota Scion xB. People are either devoted fans or relentless critics, and that’s good.

POSITIVE. Entrepreneurship isn’t war, so you don’t describe your enterprise in warlike terms. Your organization’s purpose is not to put another organization out of business. Customers don’t care if you want to destroy the competition. They want to know what benefits they derive from patronizing your company or service.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC. Positioning is about what you do for your customers—not about what you want to become. Announcing that your organization is “the leading company” is egocentric, not customer-centric. It’s also impractical: How can you prove you’re the leader? How can you prevent another organization from declaring that it is the leader—just as you have?

SPECIFIC. Good positioning targets the intended customer. If you are the target customer, you immediately understand that. If you’re not, you understand that, too. For example, “increase the security of Web sites” is a mediocre and vague value proposition, compared to “reduce the risk of fraud for commercial banks in their online transactions.”

As a startup, you’re trying to start a fire with matches, not flamethrowers. (Hence, the design of this book’s cover.) Few startup organizations can afford or manage a flamethrower. In other words, put one niche in your basket, hatch it, put another niche in your basket, hatch it…and soon you’ll have a whole bunch of niches that add up to market domination.

Spend the time and effort to come up with a good name—it makes positioning easier. Here are some tips for the process: HAVE A FIRST INITIAL THAT’S EARLY IN THE ALPHABET. Someday your organization’s, product’s, or service’s name will appear in an alphabetical list. Better to be early in the list than later. Imagine, for example, a trade show with a thousand exhibitors. Do you want to be in the first third or last third of the show’s directory?Also, avoid words that begin with X or Z because they are difficult to spell out after hearing them. For example, if you heard “Xylinx,” would you think that it’s spelled “Xylinx” or “Zylinx”? AVOID NUMBERS. They are bad ideas for names because people won’t remember whether to use numerals (123) or to spell out the number (One Two Three). PICK A NAME WITH “VERB POTENTIAL.” In a perfect world, your name enters the mainstream vernacular and becomes a verb. For example, people “xerox” documents—as opposed to photocopy them.More recently, people “google” words instead of “searching for them on the Internet.” Names that work as verbs are short (no more than two or three syllables) and not tongue twisters.

AWOA (a word on acronyms): Avoid multiple-word names unless the first word has solid verb potential (for example, “Google Technology Corporation” would still be fine) or the acronym spells out something clever. For example, the name Hawaiian Islands Ministry, a parachurch organization that trains pastors and ministers, becomes “HIM”—a clever homonym with “hymn” and a play on “Him,” that is, God.

SOUND DIFFERENT (AS OPPOSED TO “THINK DIFFERENT”). The name should sound like nothing else. For (a bad) example: Claris, Clarins, Claritin, and Claria. It’s hard to remember which name refers to software, cosmetics, antihistamines, or online marketing. Even if you did remember, it’s likely that you would associate all four words with one category, and that can’t be good in three of four instances. SOUND LOGICAL. In addition to sounding different, your names should also sound logical. That is, they should “match” what you do. A good example of this is the names of the Pokémon characters. They are among the most clever examples of naming that you’ll come across. Take Geodude and Lickitung, for example.Ask your kids to show you the cards of the characters Beautifly, Delcatty, Flygon, and Huntail, and you’ll see what I mean about logical names and good positioning. AVOID THE TRENDY. With hindsight, we made two mistakes naming Garage Technology Ventures when we started it in 1997. First, we initially called the company “garage.com.” Unfortunately, dotcom acquired negative connotations when the Internet tide went out because it came to stand for companies run by people without business acumen in markets without business models.The second mistake was lowercasing the “g” in garage.com. It was a silly act of pseudohumility, but those were silly times. The problem with the lowercase “g” was that it was hard to pick it out in blocks of text. The visual cue that the word was a proper noun wasn’t there—you’d think that someone named guy (sic) would know this. Also, no one could really figure out what to do when a sentence started with “garage.com”—should it be capitalized or not?

Before you cut yourself, heed this advice about the art of using PowerPoint as a means to an end. USE A DARK BACKGROUND. A dark background communicates seriousness and substance. A white or light background looks cheap and amateurish. Also, staring at a harsh white presentation for forty-five minutes gets tiring for the eyes. Think about this: Have you ever seen movie credits that use black text on a white background? ADD YOUR LOGO TO THE MASTER PAGE. Every presentation is a chance to build brand awareness for your organization, so put your logo on the master slide page. By doing this, your logo will appear on every slide. USE COMMON, SANS SERIF FONTS. A presentation is not the place to show that you’ve accumulated the world’s largest collection of fonts. Use common fonts because someday your presentation may need to be given on a computer that has a different collection of fonts than your computer has. Also, use sans serif fonts because they are much easier to read than the delicate serif font you love. You can never go wrong with Arial. ANIMATE YOUR BODY, NOT YOUR SLIDES. PowerPoint has more than sixty ways to animate text and graphics. This is about fifty-nine too many. Many entrepreneurs use animations and transitions between slides to jazz up their presentations. Do you really think that a “faded fly-in from the bottom left” is going to make a presentation better? Do yourself a favor: Don’t use fancy animations. Use your body, not PowerPoint, to communicate expressiveness, emotion, and enthusiasm. Generally speaking, if you think something is cool, cut it. “BUILD” BULLETS. Most entrepreneurs don’t use bullets. They display and read big blocks of long text. That’s a mistake. Use bullets instead: short bursts of text that capture the main point. Even when entrepreneurs use bullets, they put them all up at once. That’s also a mistake. Build your bullets: click, bullet 1, explain; click, bullet 2, explain; click, bullet 3, explain. This is the only time you should use animation, and I recommend using the simple “appear” animation at that. USE ONLY ONE LEVEL OF BULLETS. The use of bullets with bullets means that you’re trying to communicate too much information on a slide or that your thinking is fuzzy. Each slide should communicate one point, with bullets to support that point. If you observe the 30 part of the 10/20/30 rule, it will be hard to have bullets with bullets, anyway. ADD DIAGRAMS AND GRAPHS. Better a bullet than a block of text, but better a diagram or graph than a bullet. Use diagrams to explain how your business works. Use graphs to explain trends and numerical results. And build your diagrams and pictures by bringing in these elements with clicks, just like bullets. MAKE PRINTABLE SLIDES. There is a cautionary aspect to adding diagrams and graphics. Sometimes these objects build upon, and cover, previous ones. This is okay during a presentation but not when printed, so ensure that your slides work for this use, too.

SET AND COMMUNICATE GOALS. The simple act of setting goals and communicating them increases the likelihood that your organization will achieve them. It gets everyone on the same page and provides a day-to-day guide for what employees need to do. This applies to every task: finalizing specifications, building a prototype, signing up early customers, shipping, collecting, recruiting, finishing marketing materials…the list is endless. MEASURE PROGRESS. Goals only work if you measure progress. As the old saying goes, “What gets measured gets done.” This also means you’d better pick the right goals, or the wrong things will get done. In a startup, you should measure and report results every thirty days. As your organization gets older and more deliberate, you can shift to a quarterly schedule. ESTABLISH A SINGLE POINT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. If it takes more than ten seconds to figure out who is responsible for achieving a goal, something is wrong. Good people accept accountability. Great people ask for it. For the good of your entire organization, establish it. A person who knows he is being measured and held accountable is highly motivated to succeed. REWARD THE ACHIEVERS. The people you reward in a startup are the ones who deliver. You can use options, money, public praise, days off, or free lunches—it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you recognize achievers—and only achievers, not the people who are along for the ride. FOLLOW THROUGH UNTIL AN ISSUE IS DONE OR IRRELEVANT. We all like to work on the newest, hottest stuff. It’s human nature. Who wouldn’t rather be involved with the next breakthrough product rather than fixing the current one? Don’t stop when something simply gets boring. Fixing bugs may be boring to you, but it’s not to the customer who recently bought your product. HEED MORPHEUS. Realism is the ally of execution, so pay attention to what your Morpheus says. Everyone in a given company is in denial about something. Some denial is good for an entrepreneur—for example, denying that the “experts” are right when they say you can’t succeed. The critical issue is whether the denial is ultimately going to hurt the organization. Insist on realism, and your organization will bootstrap better. ESTABLISH A CULTURE OF EXECUTION. Execution is not a onetime event. Nor is it a process where you check off goals as if your sixth-grade teacher were looking over your shoulder. Rather, execution is a culture that produces a set of organizationwide habits. The only way to establish this culture is for the CEO to set the right example: answering inquiries, solving problems, and promoting people who deliver results. This sends an unmistakable message: Execution counts in this organization.

I can provide five ways to avoid hiring the wrong people: DON’T CONFUSE CORRELATION AND CAUSATION. A candidate may have worked at an organization when it achieved success; this doesn’t necessarily mean he contributed to the success. He could have just been along for the ride. The rising tide floats all boats. To separate the eagles from the dodos, find out what specific projects the candidate managed and analyze his results. Also, try to find someone inside the company who worked with the person to see if the candidate caused or correlated. DON’T CONFUSE BIG-ORGANIZATION SKILLS WITH NEW-ORGANIZATION SKILLS. Success in a big organization doesn’t guarantee success in a startup. The skills needed in each context are different. A vice president of Microsoft (with its established brand, infinite resources, and 100 percent market share) may not be the right person for a “two guys in a garage” operation. BIG ORGANIZATION SKILLS STARTUP SKILLS Sucking up to the boss Being the boss Generating paper profits Generating cash flow Beating charges of monopoly Establishing a beachhead Evolving products and services Creating products and services Market research Shipping Squeezing the distribution channel Establishing a distribution channel DRAMATIZE YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Make it crystal clear that working in a startup is different from what they might be used to in their previous organization: “Can you function without a secretary, fly coach, and stay in cheap motels?” You might scare off a few desirable candidates this way, but it’s worth risking this to avoid ending up with people who cannot function in a startup atmosphere. READ THE TEA LEAVES WHEN CHECKING REFERENCES. Because the laws in the United States prevent providing job references that may damage a candidate’s ability to get a job, whenever you don’t get a reference that’s superlative, you are in effect getting a negative one. If the reference sends you to the human resources department, then you know the candidate had problems. (See the end of this chapter for more on reference checking.) TRUST THE RICHEST VEIN. Your current employees are the richest resource for finding great people and for preventing a bozo explosion at your organization. If your employees aren’t motivated to bring in good staff, who is? If there’s a close call between two candidates, and one is known by an employee, you should usually take that one.

A vice president of Microsoft (with its established brand, infinite resources, and 100 percent market share) may not be the right person for a “two guys in a garage” operation. BIG ORGANIZATION SKILLS STARTUP SKILLS Sucking up to the boss Being the boss Generating paper profits Generating cash flow Beating charges of monopoly Establishing a beachhead Evolving products and services Creating products and services Market research Shipping Squeezing the distribution channel Establishing a distribution channel DRAMATIZE YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Make it crystal clear that working in a startup is different from what they might be used to in their previous organization: “Can you function without a secretary, fly coach, and stay in cheap motels?” You might scare off a few desirable candidates this way, but it’s worth risking this to avoid ending up with people who cannot function in a startup atmosphere. READ THE TEA LEAVES WHEN CHECKING REFERENCES. Because the laws in the United States prevent providing job references that may damage a candidate’s ability to get a job, whenever you don’t get a reference that’s superlative, you are in effect getting a negative one. If the reference sends you to the human resources department, then you know the candidate had problems. (See the end of this chapter for more on reference checking.) TRUST THE RICHEST VEIN. Your current employees are the richest resource for finding great people and for preventing a bozo explosion at your organization. If your employees aren’t motivated to bring in good staff, who is? If there’s a close call between two candidates, and one is known by an employee, you should usually take that one.
